## Power To The Devis Who Walk This Earth



### Introduction



```markdown
<p> Women have always been seen as " the other half". Their entity has been denied of autonomy from the dawn of time. They have been perceived as the ‘weaker’ sex from a man’s perspective, treated as men’s property or commodity. Women have been denied the basic human rights that men are given from birth. However, change has begun to come with awareness, activism, and social reforms. After fighting for years against the discrimination – American women have established themselves as the role models for the rest of the world to follow. However, this does not mean that they have the equality or safety from the oppression that men thrust upon them. When women fight back the misogyny in our society, they face the ‘backlash’. A ‘Backlash’ is a strong and adverse reaction imposed on someone by a group of people. Renowned feminist Naomi Wolf cautioned women about the toxic effects of the backlash in her Commencement Address at Scripps College on May 17, 1992. With this- she judiciously presented the ‘backlash survival kit’, which is to be used as life lessons for women. Wolf’s lessons elaborate that women should redefine what it means by becoming a woman, by becoming the goddesses of disobedience (Wolf, page 158-159). Women must break men’s restrictions, until they have attained equality. </p>
