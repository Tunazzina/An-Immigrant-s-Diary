    <h1>Power To The Devis Who Walk This Earth</h1>

        <h2> Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Women have always been seen as " the other half". Their entity has been denied of autonomy from the dawn of time. They have been perceived as the ‘weaker’ sex from a man’s perspective, treated as men’s property or commodity. Women have been denied the basic human rights that men are given from birth. However, change has begun to come with awareness, activism, and social reforms. After fighting for years against the discrimination – American women have established themselves as the role models for the rest of the world to follow. However, this does not mean that they have the equality or safety from the oppression that men thrust upon them. When women fight back the misogyny in our society, they face the ‘backlash’. A ‘Backlash’ is a strong and adverse reaction imposed on someone by a group of people. Renowned feminist Naomi Wolf cautioned women about the toxic effects of the backlash in her Commencement Address at Scripps College on May 17, 1992. With this- she judiciously presented the ‘backlash survival kit’, which is to be used as life lessons for women. Wolf’s lessons elaborate that women should redefine what it means by becoming a woman, by becoming the goddesses of disobedience (Wolf, page 158-159). Women must break men’s restrictions, until they have attained equality.

        <h2>
            Against the tools of Misogyny   
        </h2>
        <p>
            Misogyny is a painful concept every girl has to grow up with. It feeds the root of patriarchy that runs deep in our society. What is misogyny? 
The word, which conventionally means hatred of women, was once a radical accusation. But recently, it seems to have eclipsed the gentler “sexism” and “chauvinism” in popular use…the term is used to describe social inequity, evidenced by things such as the gendered wage gap in the United States, the difficulties women have in finding adequate medical care (Aron). 
Misogyny raises its ugly head in different forms in a woman’s life. It can start from body- shaming and can escalate to physical violence. It can come from a complete stranger or a beloved younger brother. Misogyny has restricted women from reaching their full potential over the ages. 
Religion is the biggest weapon men used against women. “All of the major religions of the world depreciate women to some degree.” (Kenton, page 1). Women only began gaining basic human rights by reforming or rejecting the religions, unlike men who found shelter in them. Christianity is the largest religion in the United States. Christianity has gone through many reforms regarding the rights of women. Christian women now have a voice and rights of decision making. In the western countries, they have almost the same rights as men do. Christianity now allows women to become pastors, notable among them are Paula White and Victoria Osteen. Owing to the social reforms- misogynistic religions like Islam cannot practice Sharia Law in the USA. This fact gives Muslim women the liberty and protection to pursue education and freedom if they wish. Judaism stands in the middle of Christianity and Islam over women’s rights. Women are now allowed to read their Holy book the Torah, which was previously only accessible to men.
 Science was yet another tool for men to subjugate women. Men started to monopolize this area back when the earth was trodden by dangerous creatures and women had to remain indoors to raise the children, tend their caves, and mend their garments. After human civilization gained a strong footing, men outright denied women the access to science and education. However, despite the adversity – there have always been a few trailblazing women who have challenged men’s assumptions on women’s lack of intelligence. They kept striving to practice science on their own. In 1848, Maria Mitchell became the first woman who was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1903, Marie Curie became the first woman to win the Nobel Prize in Physics, and she won it again in Chemistry in 1911. Since the establishment of the Nobel Prize in 1895, 53 women have been honored with this prestigious international award. Even so, the rate is increasing. In 2020, four women won the Nobel Prize ; namely -Louise Glück, Emmanuelle Charpentier, Jennifer A. Doudna, and Andrea M. Ghez. The latter three won in Physics and Chemistry. Their accomplishment proves that women’s contributions in the field of intellect have much more to offer if gender-based adversities are taken away. In 1983, NASA astronaut Sally Ride became the first woman from the USA to go to the space. Fast forward to 2020, a 17-year-old Alyssa Carson is on a training program with NASA to become an astronaut. She dreams to become the first person on Mars. Progress is coming at a lightning speed! Pioneers aside- more regular women are entering the field of science as well. The percentage of female students is increasing in STEM degrees . STEM means Science, Technology, Engineering, and  Math, including cutting-edge fields, such as Architecture, Computer & Information Sciences, Engineering, Statistics etc. Admittedly, there is still a huge gender gap with men. Only 6.7% of women graduate college with a STEM degree on average and the number of STEM graduates in 2016 was 37% female in contrast to 63% male, according to a survey by Microsoft corporation (Stockwell). However, this is still an improvement over the past. 
Not only in science, but women were not allowed to be skillful professionals, except for the work to be hired as cooks or nurses. They were not allowed to be in the Medical school and graduate as doctors. They were not expected to have the ‘mental scope’ to be equals with men. In 1849, Elizabeth Blackwell became the first woman in the United States to be granted an MD degree. Women now make up more than one-third of the physicians in the U.S.A., according to March 2019 data from the Kaiser Family Foundation. Currently, there are a little more than 1 million physicians practicing in the U.S.A. 359,409 of whom are female. This means that the gender ratio is 1 female to per 1.8 male physicians (Bean). This may be beneficial for female patients because female physicians tend to care for their patients differently than male physicians do. The number of female physicians increased from 37,189 in 1980 to 148,768 in 2000, an increase of 300 percent (compared with an increase of only 44 percent for men).  These numbers are expected to grow, and the rate is steadily increasing ( Salsberg et al.). 
What held women back for so many years? Misconception and misogyny. Women’s brains have been weighed and their capabilities were measured by its size, not by its convolutions. Their biology was considered inferior and fragile. The ‘inferior’ nature of women’s brains was used as the reason to treat them as the ‘weaker’ sex. Women were forced to focus on their reproductive gifts . They were forced to leave education, power, politics, science, and any other business of the world to men. The concept has changed as is evident by the mantra modern women follow now: “ One is not born, rather becomes, a woman.”(Beauvoir, page 13) . They become women by their accomplishments, not by mere biology. When the essence of womanhood mixes with their ‘smaller-sized’ brain, they end up accomplishing a complex task that ‘big-brained’ men cannot.

          A nation belongs equally to its male and female citizens. “This nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom—and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth” (Lincoln). Unfortunately, when the USA became a free nation- women did not get their right to vote. Women earned the right to vote after the ratification of the 19th amendment on August 18th, 1920. This happened by an action called ‘Women’s suffrage movement’. One leader of the movement, Alice Paul said shortly after the ratification of the 19th amendment “It is incredible to me that any woman should consider the fight for full equality won. It is just beginning”(Hill, page 8). Women who joined the movement were called suffragists (who took a peaceful stand) and suffragettes ( who were willing to take direct, militant action ) . Many of them were arrested, imprisoned, beaten, and abused in order to subdue. Alice Paul went on a hunger strike with fellow suffragettes. She was incarcerated in the psychiatric ward and was force fed raw eggs and milk, so she would not die and become a martyr. Yes, the right did not come easy, but it came. It started from the right to vote to women being elected in trustee boards, mayoral elections, and now women are even running for President. Though there has not been a single President of the United States who is a woman, but Hilary Clinton came awfully close in 2016. Sadly enough, people chose a misogynistic white male in her stead, perpetuating the scepter of Patriarchy. Hilary’s powerhouse voters were the women of color, and their small number in comparison to the white, patriarchal population was not large enough to win the election. Once again- patriarchy and whiteness came to power, jeopardizing the fates of non-whites, women, disabled people, and immigrants. Women all over the country revolted on the unfair election. They joined in a worldwide protest called Women's March on January 21, 2017, the day after President Donald Trump’s inauguration. The March dealt with important issues of human rights, women's rights, healthcare reform, reproductive rights, LGBTQ rights, racial equality, religious freedom etc., because “Human rights are women's rights.... And women's rights are human rights.” (Clinton). 
There were 6 female candidates running for the 2020 democratic nomination, but none of them became the nominee. To see the smartest, most qualified, most talented people drop out of the race because too many Democrats-even women- were afraid that a woman wasn’t “electable” or said, “I want to vote for a woman, but she’s just too this or too that” about each of them, until the only contenders left were the usual older white men?” (Hill, page 31)
 However, all hope is not gone. For the first time in the history of the USA- a woman has become the Vice president elect in 2020. Kamala Devi Harris is not even white, she is Asian-American. She has reached a milestone that no women before her could, for due reasons. Maybe, baby steps are better for the USA than no steps at all. A Vice -President will pave the way for the future female President of the United States. Lauren Underwood- the youngest black woman to be elected to Congress, may become the first female President someday. Another hopeful candidate is Alexandria Ocasio Cortez. Cortez is the youngest female in the Congress who came from a LatinX background. The future has a lot to offer with young, brilliant minds like theirs moving towards the top. 
Politics is still like the chess board in the USA, where the Queen does all the hard work, but the King still rules in the end. Women’s contributions in politics and economy were never duly recognized ( especially in the case of women of color). Women are hardly credited for the work they do. The scene needs more time to change to accommodate women’s needs. Men who have actually held power are willing to go great lengths to protect and maintain their power. When people in power have no firsthand experience with the challenges and needs of more than half of the population, then they may never try to remove those challenges and tend to those needs. Therefore, in order to truly accomplish equality, women need to have people in power who can represent them. Women need female leaders. This is why so many women voted in the House of Representatives in 2018.

     <h2>
        The Glass Ceiling or the 21st Century Corset
     </h2>   

     <p>
        The Glass ceiling is misconception. It’s a misleading metaphor, which indicates an invisible barrier to advancement that women face at the ‘top’ levels of the workplace. It gives the illusion that the barrier is ‘high up there’, whereas even regular women feel the presence of the barrier in their everyday lives. Even though the push becomes harder when they near the top, the challenges women feel regarding their careers are not just at the top! The barrier exists in all levels of their journey, during which they drop out of the race one by one. Some drop out at level one, some at level two and so on. When a small number of women near the top, then its presence is announced as the glass ‘ceiling’. It should be called ‘the 21st century corset’ that squeezes on women all the way when they venture their career goals, until they run out of breath.
        Women can be marines now; they can be firefighters too. But the rate is very low. In 2018, only 93,700 (8%) of the firefighters were female. Of the career firefighters, 15,200 (4%) were female firefighters. (Evarts et al.). Although fire stations started hiring women decades ago, some still have only one woman firefighter, and some have none. 
       Statistics prove that, despite all the effort women have put, top leadership in every major sector is still overwhelmingly male. 
       Women make up just 5% of Fortune 500 CEOs. They make 7% of all top executives in  
       the Fortune 100 companies. They hold only 6 % of all venture capital board 
       representatives and lead only 9 % of venture capital deals. Although record number of women were elected to office in 2018, they still make up just 24 %t of Congress. They hold 28 % of seats in state legislatures. They represent 18% of governors and are only 23% of the mayors of the 100 largest American cities (Hill , page 11). 
       What creates the so called Glass Ceiling? There is plenty of anecdotal evidence that sexism has prevented many talented women from achieving their full potential at work. But there are also some factors that go beyond gender discrimination in the workplace. Besides misogyny, the socially imposed responsibilities like childcare , elderly care,  housework and other life chores  at home are the major reasons behind the existence of the ‘glass ceiling’. Worldwide, 75% of unpaid work in the house is done by women. Higher paying occupations demand total devotion and major time commitment. Women have difficulty with this inflexibility because they remain responsible for taking care of the home, including raising children. Childcare is the biggest factor for holding back women's earnings at the executive level, If wives overcome this and earn more than their husbands do, then it strains on their relationship. The marriage becomes unhappy , can even end in divorce (Bertrand). 
       It takes a woman like Michelle Obama to give perfection to an amazing President like Barak Obama. She mentions in the autobiography how she provided him with the support he needed to run for President, how she held his hand which helped him win the election again, how she battled through motherhood while trying to provide their two daughters with a normal life. The Obama family showed the world what it means to be idealistic (Obama).On the other hand, during a debate when Bill Clinton was the President, he was accused by a rival of delivering favorable contracts to his wife’s law firm. Hillary commented to that by saying, “I suppose I could have stayed home, baked cookies and had teas,” Hillary was speaking of “the sort of thing that happens to women who have their own careers.” (White) 
       Women spend three to six hours a day on housework compared to men's average of 30 minutes to two hours. 61% of the housework is undertaken by women . Men usually do not take emotionally draining work like elderly care, which involves taking the elderly to the toilet, bathing, dressing, feeding them, dealing with their urinary incontinence and temper tantrums. While men engage on leisurely pursuits like watching TV or playing games , women clean the toilets and tend the vulnerable members of the family. US men on average spend an hour of spare time per day to rest than their female counterparts A 2010 US study on the imbalance between the amount of unpaid work done by male and female scientists found that female scientists do 54% of the cooking, cleaning, and laundry in their households adding more than 10 hours to their nearly 60 hour work week. Men's contribution is only 28% , which is half the time of women’s work. Female scientists do 54 % of the parenting labor in their households while male scientists do only 36% . Due to the workload at home women tend to work part-time is as part-time in several jobs than working full time which allows men who work full time to earn more money than women do (Perez , page 4).Women on average make 78 cents per male dollar (Kendall, page 9 ).
        Another reason for the pay gap is that college-educated women, more often than men, avoid majors that lead to higher-earning occupations. some have none. Some reasons for that are their perception of those fields as masculine, and lack of female role models. Women need more role models in the higher paying majors. Besides these, psychological differences between men and women could account for up to 10 percent of the pay gap. Much of the existing research concludes that women are more risk-averse than men are. When employees are willing to take risks, they opt to compete for higher paying jobs and negotiate higher salaries. Whether men and women are born with different attitudes toward risk or the differences are taught, understanding the role of nature versus nurture is key to closing the gap (Shurchkov et al.). 
       Nowadays, family-friendly work policies such as longer and paid maternity leaves, paternity leaves, optional part-time or shorter work hours, and working remotely is helping women to find some balance. Technological advances in the workplace and home such as artificial intelligence, will change the structure of work and will pave the way for change. Previously existent reason of discrimination for pay gap no longer exists, and there are law firms to stand against the income inequality now.

<h2>
    Their voices and their choices
</h2>
<p>
     Does sexism still exist in our society? The answer sadly is- yes. In remains in the form of ‘shadow sexism ‘. This shadow sexism was bravely exposed by young lawyer Anita Hill when she testified against a Supreme Court nominee named Clarence Thomas’ who had harassed her sexually at the workplace. Workplace was more adverse for women in the 1990s than it is now. Anita Hill was backed up by future Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. At that time- Ginsburg was a prominent lawyer and she was well-reputed for fighting gender discrimination. After the hearing, both of them became cultural figures in their fight for gender equality. Anita Hill hearing was the beginning of 3rd wave feminism . In 2006- activist Tarana Burke started using the phrase “me too” on social media to raise awareness about the pervasiveness of sexual harassment. 4th wave feminism began in 2008 with social media hashtags like #YesAllWomen and #StandWithWendy (Wendy Davis is now running for Congress. She is well known for filibustering a Texas anti- abortion law) . After the Women's March in 2017- women united with a collective power and started speaking out about workplace harassment and abuse in a new way by using #metoo on social media. On October 5th, 2017, a group of women came out and accused famous producer Harvey Weinstein of harassment, rape, and assault. Women (and some men) soon exposed Roy Price, Larry Nassar, Kevin Spacey, Roy Moore, Louis CK, Al Franken, Matt Lauer- a massive number of male public figures who forced into accountability for their heinous crime. Women worldwide started sharing their stories of harassment and assault and #metoo became an international phenomenon. #metoo was followed by ‘Time's Up’ movement against sexual harassment, founded by Hollywood celebrities. Soon afterwards, women of Hollywood described experiences of sexual assault and harassment at the workplace through a letter to The New York Times. The letter was written on behalf of  approximately 700,000 female film workers. Time's Up movement announced the desire to support women, men, people of color, and the LGBT community to fight harassment. It took initiatives by establishing a legal fund to fight in defense of sexual assault victims (Hill, 37-38).
Feminism includes LGBTQIA rights too . LGBTQIA people are equal sufferers of the repercussions that come from toxic masculinity. Every year, LGBTQIA people are killed and assaulted by men who are strict on imposing a society that is built for cisgender heteronormative patriarch communities. Trans women suffer disproportionate levels of sexual and domestic abuse from their partners, showing quite clearly that this is, in fact, a feminist issue. Trans women know what it’s like not to have their fears listened to. It is beneficial for all marginalized communities to work together and bring changes that let everyone to live and love. When feminism supports trans rights, everybody wins. This response should be a concern for anyone that cares about creating a more equal and fair society (Fisher).
 Owing to constant trials against such adversities, young women of today have remarkable role models whom they can follow. Nancy Pelosi and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in politics, Oprah Winfrey in Entertainment, late Ruth Bader Ginsburg in the Judicial system, Sheryl Sandberg in business, Betsy DeVos in education, Kim Ng in sports industry are some of the trailblazing women who have left their footprints everywhere young women can walk on.

<h3>
    Conclusion 
</h3>
<p>
    Women have suffered a lot in the hands of patriarchy and toxic misogyny. But it is women who found their way to break free of their shackles. They have raised their voices, made their choices, and gained empowerment through hundreds of years of trial. Present is the best time in the history of women’s freedom and accomplishment. The goal of attaining gender equality has come closer than ever before. Just a few more steps, and they will be there.
